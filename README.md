# Let's Go: Learn Go in 30 days

This is my jounery to learn Go in 30 days throught projects and hand-on tutorials. You can find all resources I've been using day after day. I was inspired by the mantra _"Learn something by building"_ after reading _Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ book. To learn most of the concepts I've been using [Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests). For more resources, see [Let's Go post](https://canro91.github.io/2020/07/05/LetsGoStudyPlan/)
